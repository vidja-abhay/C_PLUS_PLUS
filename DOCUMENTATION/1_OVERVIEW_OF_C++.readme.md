# C++ 

- C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.
- C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language.
- This language allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications and software development, game development, and operating system programming.

## Applications of C++

- **Operating Systems** : C++ is most widely used programming language and become an ideal choice for developing operating systems. Mac OS X has majority of parts written in C++ and Most of Microsoftâ€™s software like Windows, Microsoft Office, IDE Visual Studio, and Internet Explorer are also written in C++.

- **Games** : C++ is widely used for game development, and companies often choose it as their first option for developing gaming systems. The Unreal Engine, a popular game engine, uses C++.

- **Web Browsers** : Most of the browsers in Computers are developed in C++ for effecting goals and Mozilla Firefox is totally developed by C++ and Google Applications and software like Chrome and Google File System are partly written in C++.

- **Compilers** : Compilers of many programming languages are designed in C and C++ and this is because they are moderately lower-level when compared to other higher-level programming languages and C/C++ are closer to the hardware.

- **Embedded systems** : Embedded systems that need the program closer to the hardware such as smartwatches, medical equipment systems, mobile phones etc., are developed in C++.
